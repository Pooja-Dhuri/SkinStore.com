### Skin-Store is E-commerce website where we have cosmetic products like skincare, haircare, selfcare ,bath & body like products.

This is our first project at Masai School using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We worked on “Shop.com”, an online shopping store.

## Technologies we used

1. We used HTML-5 and CSS-3 for front-end
2. Javascript for back-end
3. Localstorage is used for the data-storing purpose (as we are not introduced to the databases till now)
